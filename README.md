# A Cloud Guru Challenge: Your resume in Azure

Hi there!

This repository is hosting the code and documentation of the A Cloud Guru Challenge: Your resume in Azure.

The idea is to build a resume and host it using Azure services.

## The steps

* [X] Create a GitHub repository
* [ ] Create the website (HTML, CSS...)
* [ ] Add a visitor counter on the website
* [ ] Deploy the website to Azure Blob storage
* [ ] Set up GitHub actions
* [ ] Write a blog post to describe the process

## My journey

I already worked on the Cloud Resume challenge before. The goal was to host my resume on AWS.

I have a decent knowledge of AWS and passed the AZ-900 but I'm not working on a daily basis with Azure. This challenge is a way to get some experience with it.
